Sell it to aliens, tattoo it on a goat, rewrite it in Comic Sans.  
I won’t stop you.

1. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  
2. If you become a millionaire from this, congrats. Just don’t forget to brag.  
3. It would be kind of nice (but not mandatory) if you gave a shoutout  
   to the original repo: [repo](https://github.com/Kishmat/yopl.git)
4. There is no step 4.
5. You're on your own. Don’t ask me how it works — I probably forgot.
