## Contributing  

?> Honestly, I don't know what you thought before coming here but yeah fine, contributing is really easy since there are so much stuffs to improve.

Literally everything will feel like a contribution here.  \
Spotted a typo? Congrats, you’ve contributed.  \
Added a semicolon somewhere it wasn’t? Still counts.  \
Wrote an actually useful feature? You’re basically a hero.  

Right now, though, the things YOPL would really love help with are:  
- Crossplatform Modules — because right now only windows is supported for use of modules.
- Error handling — because the current system just shrugs and goes absolutely crazy over errors without mentioning the cause.  
- Module development — more `.yopl.mod` fakery to expand the “custom magic.”  
- Objects datatype — because someday, somehow, we might want things that act like… well, objects.  

Everything counts, and honestly, the bar is so low that if you breathe near the repo, I’ll probably merge your PR.
