# Writing Modules in YOPL
So you want to write a YOPL module? Congratulations, you’re about to touch the **black magic** of YOPL.\

?> But very first make sure to keep a copy of `module.h` header file from [here](https://github.com/Kishmat/yopl/blob/main/api/module.h).

Because we like to make life interesting, we’ve split this into **two pages**:  

1. [**For Nerds**](module_nerd.md) – The barebones, “just the essentials, figure the rest out yourself” version.  
   - If you don’t understand anything like I don’t understand how half of this works either, pick this one.  
   - Quick, brutal, no hand-holding. Perfect for those who like their information raw and spicy.  

2. [**For Non-Nerds**](module_still_nerd.md) – The detailed, slightly friendlier, “maybe you’ll survive this” version.  
   - If you actually want step-by-step guidance, examples, and explanations that don’t make you cry, go here.  
   - It still has sarcasm, because let’s be honest, YOPL is not going to hold your hand.
