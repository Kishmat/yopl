# Welcome to YOPL 😎 :id=welcome
YOPL — short for **You're On Your Own Programming Language.**<br>
Yes, the name is a hint. No, I’m not going to hold your hand.

## What YOPL Is
- An interpreted language that sometimes does what you expect.
- Supports printing, input, basic math, conditionals, functions… ahm. mostly.
- Lightweight.
**That’s about it.**

## Why YOPL Exists
Because other languages explain things. YOPL? Not so much.\
It gives you the tools and then… well, you figure it out.

## Error Messages (or Lack Thereof)

If your code crashes, don’t worry. The errors are **vague and mysterious**.\
*Ahm… maybe also because I don’t really know how to make proper error messages.* Call it a feature.

## Who Should Use YOPL
- People who want to blame the language
- Anyone okay with “what does this even mean?” moments.

?> Yes, there are rules, functions, and operators.
