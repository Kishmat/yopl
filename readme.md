# YOPL - You're On Your Own Programming Language

Welcome to **YOPL**, the language where you're on your own – literally.

This is a VS Code extension that provides just enough features to make you think you're coding in a real language. It includes:

### 🔧 Features

- Syntax highlighting so it *looks* like code.
- Autoclosing brackets because we're not animals.
- Indentation and folding rules, because chaos still needs structure.
- Autocomplete and function signatures (sometimes helpful, sometimes cryptic).
- Ctrl+Click navigation, just because.
- A run button that may or may not do what you expect.

### ❓ What is YOPL?

No one really knows. Not even the author.

If you’re looking for documentation, good luck. You're on your own. It’s literally in the name. But I will create a notepad documentation and release it if I feel like it.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install this extension.
2. Open a `.yopl` file.
3. Start typing random nonsense.
4. Press the run button and hope for the best.

### 📜 License

Do whatever. Just don't blame me.

### 📦 Packaging

We’ve packed this chaos neatly into a VS Code extension. To install, download the `.vsix` (once available) and run:

```bash
code --install-extension yopl-lang.vsix 
```

Or wait for it to hit the marketplace, assuming I remember to publish it.
