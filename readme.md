# YOPL - You're On Your Own Programming Language
Welcome to **YOPL**, the language where you're on your own – literally.

## Documentation:
[Documentation](https://kishmat.github.io/yopl)

## Contributing
Literally everything will feel like a contribution here.  \
Spotted a typo? Congrats, you’ve contributed.  \
Added a semicolon somewhere it wasn’t? Still counts.  \
Wrote an actually useful feature? You’re basically a hero.  

Right now, though, the things YOPL would really love help with are:  
- Crossplatform Modules — because right now only windows is supported for use of modules.
- Error handling — because the current system just shrugs and goes absolutely crazy over errors without mentioning the cause.  
- Module development — more `.yopl.mod` fakery to expand the “custom magic.”  
- Objects datatype — because someday, somehow, we might want things that act like… well, objects.  

Everything counts, and honestly, the bar is so low that if you breathe near the repo, I’ll probably merge your PR.

The only thing that would be *nice* (totally optional, not enforced, no lawyers involved) is if you throw a little link back to this repo somewhere in your work.  
Just a tiny nod like:

Not required, but hey, it makes me feel cool.
